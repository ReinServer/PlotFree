This repository takes the source code from PlotSquared, builds it, then publishes it here every now and then, available for free, <b>forever!</b>
<br>
<br>
I originally created this repo since I couldn't afford the PlotSquared plugin. Failed building it the first time and gave up. Now, I was able to get a successful build! Hooray.
<br>
<br>
Builds are posted here every now and then, available for free. <b>But please, if you can, show some love to the PlotSquared team, They deserve it. If you can afford the plugin, buy it.</b>

The original repository is available at https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared/. <b>Do not create issue tickets for builds here on their repository! These are development builds and not release builds, so expect issues!</b>
